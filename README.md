# Thinkful's Solving Problems with Arrays lesson for Java.

Purpose: find out how many new covid cases occur each day.
*just an exercise, not accurate data*

1. We need to create the new array
2. We need a variable to keep the previous day's count so we use it in the calculation
3. We need the loop to take us through the entire array
4. in the loop calculate the current day's count and assign it to the corresponding location in the new array
5. Set the previous day's count variable to the current day's count
